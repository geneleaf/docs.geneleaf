`GeneLeaf <https://tst.geneleaf.com/>`_  is a visual editor for genomics, allowing users to quickly and intuitively add and update information on family relationships in the form of Pedigree or Genogram diagrams. GeneLeaf is a SaaS application, which users can access securely via the web, but supports offline storage of pedigree files in a proprietary format (.glf) as well as interoperability with other common pedigree file formats as well as common image formats (.svg, .png and .svg).

`GeneLeaf <https://tst.geneleaf.com/>`_  uses standard conventions to represent the family relationships included in Pedigrees, as in the example below. :term:`Pedigrees<Pedigree>` are visual representations of family relationships. These diagrams follow a specific set of formatting conventions to represent family information. These include the following key components:

* Squares/Circles: used to represent males & females
* Affected: color (including black) is used to indicate that an individual is affected by a condition.
* Spousal relationships: represented by horizontal bars between individuals
* Sibling relationshipts: represented by horizontal bars above individuals
* Generation relationshipts (parents/children): represented by vertical bars
