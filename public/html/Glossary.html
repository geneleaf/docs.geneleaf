<dd>Refers to the genetic trait involving the number of copies of a particular gene present in the genome of an individual. Genetic variants, including insertions, deletions, and duplications of segments of DNA, are also collectively referred to as CNVs. CNVs account for a significant proportion of the genetic variation between individuals. Also called copy number variant.</dd>
<dt id="term-codis">CODIS</dt>
<dd>CODIS is the acronym for the Combined DNA Index System and is the generic term used to describe the FBI’s program of support for criminal justice DNA databases as well as the software used to run these databases. Prior to January 1, 2017, the national level of CODIS required that known offender profiles have a set of 13 loci called the “CODIS core”. Since then, the requirement has expanded to include seven additional loci. Partial profiles are also allowed in CODIS in separate indexes and are common in crime scene samples that are degraded or are mixtures of multiple individuals. Upload of these profiles to the national level of CODIS requires at least eight of the core loci to be present as well as a profile rarity of 1 in 10 million (calculated using population statistics).</dd>
<dt id="term-codon">codon</dt>
<dd>In DNA or RNA, a sequence of 3 consecutive nucleotides that codes for a specific amino acid or signals the termination of gene translation (stop or termination codon).
compound heterozygosity
The presence of two different mutated alleles at a particular gene locus.</dd>
<dt id="term-compound-heterozygosity">Compound heterozygosity</dt>
<dd>Compound heterozygosity in medical genetics is the condition of having two heterogeneous recessive alleles at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state. That is, an organism is a compound heterozygote when it has two recessive alleles for the same gene, but with those two alleles being different from each other (for example, both alleles might be mutated but at different locations). Compound heterozygosity reflects the diversity of the mutation base for many autosomal recessive genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated alleles, who technically are heterozygotes, but both the alleles are defective.</dd>

The informed consent process for genetic testing should include an explanation of the medical and psychosocial risks, benefits, limitations, and potential implications of genetic analysis, a discussion of privacy, confidentiality, the documentation and handling of genetic test results, as well as options for managing the hereditary disease risk. Also called informed consent.</dd>
<dt id="term-constitutional-dna">constitutional DNA</dt>

<dt id="term-euchromatin">euchromatin</dt>
<dd>Euchromatin is a lightly packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA and protein) that is enriched in genes, and is often (but not always) under active transcription. Euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. 92% of the human genome is euchromatic. The remainder is called heterochromatin.</dd>
<dt id="term-exome">exome</dt>
<dd>The exome is the part of the genome formed by exons, the sequences which when transcribed remain within the mature RNA after introns are removed by RNA splicing. It consists of all DNA that is transcribed into mature RNA in cells of any type as distinct from the transcriptome, which is the RNA that has been transcribed only in a specific cell population. The exome of the human genome consists of roughly 180,000 exons constituting about 1% of the total genome, or about 30 megabases of DNA. Though comprising a very small fraction of the genome, mutations in the exome are thought to harbor 85% of mutations that have a large effect on disease. Exome sequencing has proved to be an efficient strategy to determine the genetic basis of more than two dozen Mendelian or single gene disorders.</dd>
<dt id="term-exon">exon</dt>

<dt id="term-family">Family</dt>
<dd>A GIMS family is a record of the genetic relationship between individuals. For example, the proband as well as the proband’s parents. In many cases, family information is captured within an order (i.e., a trio order contains the proband as well as the parents of the proband).</dd>
<dt id="term-family-history">family history<dt id="term-family-medical-history">family medical history</dt>
<dd>The genetic relationships within a family combined with the medical history of individual family members. When represented in diagram form using standardized symbols and terminology, it is usually referred to as a pedigree or family tree. Also called family medical history.</dd>

<dt id="term-fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</dt>
<dd>Fingerprinting refers to the Fluidigm-based sample identification assays used to verify the identity of samples throughout the genomic testing and analysis testing process, based on the attributes of a set of unique genomic regions, analyzed in each individual. The unique genomic regions used in this assay are highly variable, yet nominally repetitive, making them compatible with NGS technology. This assay is distinct from STR-based identification systems such as CODIS.</dd>
<dt id="term-fish">FISH<dt id="term-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization">fluorescence in situ hybridization</dt>
<dd>A technique used to identify the presence of specific chromosomes or chromosomal regions through hybridization (attachment) of fluorescently-labeled DNA probes to denatured chromosomal DNA. Examination through a microscope under fluorescent lighting detects the presence of the colored hybridized signal (and hence presence of the chromosome material) or absence of the hybridized signal (and hence absence of the chromosome material). Also called fluorescence in situ hybridization.</dd>
<dt id="term-founder-variant">founder variant<dt id="term-founder-mutation">founder mutation</dt>
<dd>A genetic alteration observed with high frequency in a group that is or was geographically or culturally isolated, in which one or more of the ancestors was a carrier of the altered gene. This phenomenon is often called a founder effect. Also called founder mutation.</dd>
<dt id="term-frameshift-variant">frameshift variant<dt id="term-frameshift-mutation">frameshift mutation</dt>
<dd>An insertion or deletion involving a number of base pairs that is not a multiple of three, which consequently disrupts the triplet reading frame of a DNA sequence. Such variants (or mutations) usually lead to the creation of a premature termination (stop) codon, and result in a truncated (shorter-than-normal) protein product. Also called frameshift variant.</dd>
<dt id="term-gene">gene</dt>
<dd>The basic unit of heredity that occupies a specific location on a chromosome. Each consists of nucleotides arranged in a linear manner. Most genes code for a specific protein or segment of protein leading to a particular characteristic or function.</dd>
<dt id="term-genetic-anticipation">genetic anticipation</dt>
<dd>A phenomenon in which the signs and symptoms of some genetic conditions tend to become more severe and/or appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next. Huntington disease is an example of a genetic disorder in which the biological mechanism for this phenomenon has been well documented. In other cases, it may be due to factors such as increased surveillance or other nongenetic causes.</dd>
<dt id="term-genetic-counseling">genetic counseling</dt>
<dd>A communication process that seeks to assist affected or at-risk individuals and families in understanding the natural history, disease risks, and mode of transmission of a genetic disorder; to facilitate informed consent for genetic testing when appropriate; to discuss options for risk management and family planning; and to provide for or refer individuals for psychosocial support as needed.</dd>
<dt id="term-genetic-heterogeneity">genetic heterogeneity</dt>
<dd>The production of the same or similar phenotypes (observed biochemical, physiological, and morphological characteristics of a person determined by his/her genotype) by different genetic mechanisms. There are two types: (1) allelic heterogeneity – when different alleles at a locus can produce variable expression of a condition; and (2) locus heterogeneity – the term used to describe disease in which mutations at different loci can produce the same disease phenotype.</dd>
<dt id="term-genetic-marker">genetic marker</dt>
<dd>An identifiable segment of DNA (e.g., Single Nucleotide Polymorphism [SNP], Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism [RFLP], Variable Number of Tandem Repeats [VNTR], microsatellite) with enough variation between individuals that its inheritance and co-inheritance with alleles of a given gene can be traced; used in linkage analysis.</dd>
<dt id="term-genetic-predisposition">genetic predisposition<dt id="term-genetic-susceptibility">genetic susceptibility</dt>

<dt id="term-southern-blot">Southern blot</dt>
<dd>Electrophoresis-based technique used in genetic testing to detect large deletions in DNA that can be missed by PCR-based genetic testing methods.</dd>
<dt id="term-specificity">specificity</dt>

<dt id="term-splice-site-mutation">splice-site mutation</dt>
<dd>A genetic alteration in the DNA sequence that occurs at the boundary of an exon and an intron (splice site). This change can disrupt RNA splicing resulting in the loss of exons or the inclusion of introns and an altered protein-coding sequence. Also called splice-site variant.</dd>
<dt id="term-splice-site-variant">splice-site variant</dt>
<dd>A genetic alteration in the DNA sequence that occurs at the boundary of an exon and an intron (splice site). This change can disrupt RNA splicing resulting in the loss of exons or the inclusion of introns and an altered protein-coding sequence. Also called splice-site mutation.</dd>
<dt id="term-splicing">splicing</dt>
<dd>The process by which introns, the noncoding regions of genes, are excised out of the primary messenger RNA transcript, and the exons (i.e., coding regions) are joined together to generate mature messenger RNA. The latter serves as the template for synthesis of a specific protein.</dd>
<dt id="term-sporadic-cancer">sporadic cancer</dt>
<dd>This term has two meanings. It is sometimes used to differentiate cancers occurring in people who do not have a germline mutation that confers increased susceptibility to cancer from cancers occurring in people who are known to carry a mutation. Cancer developing in people who do not carry a high-risk mutation is referred to as sporadic cancer. The distinction is not absolute, because genetic background may influence the likelihood of cancer even in the absence of a specific predisposing mutation. Alternatively, sporadic is also sometimes used to describe cancer occurring in individuals without a family history of cancer.</dd>
