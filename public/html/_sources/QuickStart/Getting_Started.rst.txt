GeneLeaf is a visual editor for genomics, allowing users to quickly and intuitively add and update informaiton on family relationships. GeneLeaf is a SaaS application, which users can access securely via the web. A demo version is freely accessible for anyone interested in trying the features of GeneLeaf.

Look and female
==================
GeneLeaf uses standard conventions to represent the family relationships included in Pedigrees, as in the example below. :term:`Pedigrees<Pedigree>` are visual representations of family relationships. These diagrams follow a specific set of formatting conventions to represent family information. These include the following key components:

* Squares/Circles: used to represent males & females
* Affected: color (including black) is used to indicate that an individual is affected by a condition.
* Spousal relationships: represented by horizontal bars between individuals
* Sibling relationshipts: represented by horizontal bars above individuals
* Generation relationshipts (parents/children): represented by vertical bars
