Genetics is the study of family relationships which transfer the information that determines the phenotype of each individual in form of discrete hereditary units called genes. The medium in which mosts Geneticists typically work is the pedigree diagram or genogram. In these diagrams, the relationships between individuals are represented through a simplfied set of symbols, related through lines. Gene Leaf enables users to quickly capture information in this form through an intuitive user interface, which supports rapid entry of information. Gene Leaf allows users to work at their own pace and in their own way. A simplified icon set allows users to add information with simple clicks. 

This site contains reference information on the application, including quick start guides designed to get you up and running as well as an in-depth manual to provide information on advanced topics.
